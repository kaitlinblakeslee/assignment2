        "1.1: This paper is about 'tidy' data that are easy to clean and manipulate because of their organized structure with each variable being a column, each row being a variable, and each observational unit as a table. These data sets are easier to understand as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2: The 'tidy data standard' has been designed to make initial data cleaning simpler by instructing early analysis and exploration and by simplifying the data analysis tools that work well together so the coder can focus on the 'interesting' domain problem quicker.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.3: The sentence comparing datasets to families is implying that, unlike tidy datasets, there is not a standardized way to be a 'messy' dataset just as there are many different ways a family can be messy or unhappy. The sentence about defining variables and observations means that in general there is a lot of overlap between what can be a variable and what can be an observation. In the paper, they use the example that height and weight are normally thought of as variables but change weight to width and now it may seem as if height and width are dimensions from the same variable. This illustrates the point that there can be ambiguity within a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.4: Wickham states that values can either be quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (strings) that belong to a variable and an observation. Variables are values that measure an attribute across a set of units. In contrast, observations contain all values that measure the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.5: Section 2.3 outlines a set of standards for 'tidy data' where each variable must form a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.6: The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are columns listed as values not variables, more than one variable stored in one column, variables stored in both rows and columns, different types of observational units listed in the same table, and a single observational unit stored in multiple tables. The data in table 4 is considered 'messy' because variables form both the rows and the columns, and the column headers are values and not variable names. Melting a dataset is converting columns into rows to make a molten dataset so that each column represents a variable and each row signifies an observation (tidy).\n",
        "\n",
        "1.7: Table 11 is messy because variables are stored in both rows and columns. Additionally, it also has missing values. Table 12b, on the other hand, is tidy because each column represents its own variable, and each row is a separate observation (the data has been stacked or melted).\n",
        "\n",
        "1.8: The 'chicken-and-egg' problem with tidy data is that the data is only as useful as the tidy tools that work with it that are intrinsically linked to the data itself. In this way, it can be less efficient to independently alter the data structure or tools. In the future, Wickham hopes we will build upon this framework of tidy data to make it even easier to achieve so data can be analyzed more efficiently. Specifically, Wickham wants to design better tools based on human factors and the cognitive side of analysis. Perhaps the future of data wrangling is using these tidy tools to override or ignore the original data representation and choose its own tidy format to optimize performance.\n"

        "5.1. The Census Bureau states that they gather data on race based on 'self-identification' where citizens are able to choose more than one race group. The US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has 6 categories to choose from: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Other.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.2. We gather race data for many reasons. This data provides information about disparities in healthcare, pay, job availability, housing, and more across races. The government can use it to determine where to allocate funds for specific groups that make up large portions of the population. Insurance companies use this data when offering healthcare plans, home insurance, car insurance, etc. In politics, race data draws attention to inequity. It also reminds us in society how diverse our country is and how minority populations are disproportionately worse off in society. Quality is especially important because these issues have large implications, and if the data is incorrect, then incorrect headlines and information will be spread, and unfair funding will be allocated. However, because race does not have a standard defintion and is self-identifiable, it can be hard to measure. This poses the question of how reliable this data actually is.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.3. The census is an important source of information that statisticians use to aid in policy-making and reform. It is pretty reliable data since each item is looked at individually. However, in this way it is extremely time-consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. In order to increase efficiency, the bureau may reuse data from other agencies. Yet this decreases its reliability, so there is a trade-off. A large critique is that the US census has undercounted groups that are historically undercounted (Blacks, Latinos, Other), while overcounting white and Asian populations (according to PES estimates). This could be because of the ambiguity in the choices where many people who are Hispanic/Latino indicate 'some other race' because they don't identify with the race categories listed on the form. This can negatively affect their funding so adding a specific option for 'Latino' on the form is a potential improvement for the census to gather more reliable data. This extends to other minority groups as well who are included in 'Other'.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.4. Sex and gender are becoming increasingly more contentious terms. The US Census states that they are distinct. Sex is a biological construct and gender is a social construct. The survey asks how respondents currently identify their sex, and only lists 'male' or 'female' as options. This question wording and the ambiguity of the two concepts makes this data somewhat unreliable as well when trying to determine the sex composition of the entire population. Additionally,there are no questions about gender on the census. Perhaps, asking more specific questions about what gender one was assigned at birth and what they currently identify as would give a better representation of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.5. There are privacy issues when it comes to cleaning data variables such as sex, gender, sexual identity, race, etc. If there is missing data, it would be easy to assume one's race or gender based on patterns from other survey questions answered. This gives the potential for data to be skewed based on how the data analyst chooses to handle the missing data. Additionally, certain groups of people may be less likely to want to include their gender, transgender for instance, and then these populations will not be included in the data and potentially represented in funding. To combat these issues in privacy and bias, it is essential to be transparent in how one is cleaning the data. Also using multiple different techniques to present the data in different ways is another option. An extremely bad practice would be a lack in security of this sensitive data (it should be kept anonymous). Additionally, using potentially discriminatory trends with data in race, for example, to predict other trends is dangerous and should be avoided.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.6. If an algorithm was used to predict values for race, gender, and sexual orientation, I would be concerned at how accurate/reliable the data actually is. I also feel like there is a high probability that an algorithm could reinforce stereotypes for gender based on past data. With people being able to change how they identify their gender (or their race too), this data is somewhat unpredictable, and I would not trust an algorithm to collect it. Additionally, if people specifically chose not to include this data, it feels like a violation of privacy to impute and predict this data that they did not want to share in the first place. Overall, this raises a lot of ethical concerns."
